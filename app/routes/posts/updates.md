Okay bubba it's time for a little assesment overview. It's been less than a month and we have made quite a bit of progress in my opinion. There was a recent 3-4 day period after thanksgiving where i hit a block, and a wall at the same time but there has been recent strides as of yesterday.

The tags are writing to the database and I have found the perfect app framework that allows us to manipulate the server as flexible as we need it to. It's called Remix.run and I dont think I'll be using another framework in a while.

Now that all the storage reads/writes are happening. We will have a working mvp by the end of next week if the skies stay blue. Tomorrow im gonna start loading actual tag data for searching and categorizing.

If you didn't send me any coin recently we're looking at 80 hours flat (4k) since the last payment. There was some hours of research and redos that i dont feel comfy billing you for.
