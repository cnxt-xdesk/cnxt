## Development

You'll need to run two terminals (or bring in a process manager like concurrently/pm2-dev if you like):

Start the Remix development asset server

```sh
npm run dev
```

In a new tab start your express app:

```sh
npm run start:dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, which will purge the server require cache when Remix rebuilds assets so you don't need a process manager restarting the express server.

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```
## Notes for Pardo
